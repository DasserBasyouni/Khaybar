# Khaybar

![Preview](/Preview.jpg)

I wanted to make something that could do everything I wanted it to without taking up my entire desktop, and I was quite inspired by the top bar in Elementary OS. So this is what I did. This 'top bar' is NOT a replacement for the taskbar or any other Windows functionality. Unfortunately, you really do need the latest version of Rainmeter for this skin.

As always, right click the skin and press 'Settings...' to change the settings. You can replace the user image in `Khaybar\@Resources`.

I don't usually make skins this big, so please report any issues you might encounter :)
